/// lookup), and rolls up a summary. No I/O and no clock — given the same rows it always yields the
/// same result, so the whole thing is exhaustively testable.
///
/// <para>Location signal (order-independent): an IP is "established" if the user has *any* successful
/// sign-in from it anywhere in the history. The first successful sign-in from an established IP reads
/// as <see cref="SignInLocationFlag.FirstSeen"/> ("you've not signed in from here before"). A
/// failed/blocked attempt from an IP with <em>no</em> success anywhere is
/// <see cref="SignInLocationFlag.Unfamiliar"/> — "someone tried from a place you've never signed in
/// from". A mistyped password that is immediately followed by a success from the same new device is
/// therefore not flagged, because that IP does end up with a success.</para>
