# Backup & recovery

The "I lost everything" runbook. EclipsVault seals every secret with your master key (KEK), so a
recoverable deployment is not one thing to back up — it is **three**, kept in the right places. This
expands on the summary in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) §7.

> **The one rule that matters:** the KEK is what makes a backup meaningful *and* what makes it
> dangerous. A database backup without the KEK is inert ciphertext (good — that is the point). A
> backup *beside* the KEK is plaintext waiting to be read. Keep them in **different systems with
> different access**.

## What to back up

| # | Item | Where it is | If you lose it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Database** | Your SQL Server / PostgreSQL | All secrets, versions, users, audit trail — gone. |
| 2 | **Data Protection key ring** | `DataProtection__KeyRingPath` | Sessions/antiforgery break; sealed at rest with the KEK, so it is inert on its own. |
| 3 | **The KEK** (`ECLIPSVAULT_KEK`) and any **retired KEKs** (`ECLIPSVAULT_KEK_RETIRED`) | Your secret manager / KMS | **Every secret is permanently unrecoverable.** There is no vendor recovery. |
| 4 | **Audit signing key** (`ECLIPSVAULT_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY`) | Your secret manager | You can still read the audit trail, but new checkpoints won't chain to the old ones under the same key. |

Items 1–2 go in your normal encrypted backup. Items 3–4 live in a secret manager (or KMS) and are
**never** written next to the backup, into an environment file that gets snapshotted, or into the
same cloud account with the same credentials that reach the backup.

If you use the KMS engine (`Crypto:Engine=VaultTransit`), the KEK lives in HashiCorp Vault instead of
`ECLIPSVAULT_KEK` — then item 3 is "back up / seal-and-recover your Vault Transit key" per Vault's own
runbook, and the app never holds the master key at all.

## Restore procedure

1. **Provision a clean database** and restore the backup (item 1).
2. **Restore the key ring** directory to `DataProtection__KeyRingPath` (item 2).
3. **Supply the same KEK.** Set `ECLIPSVAULT_KEK` to the exact key that sealed this data. If secrets
   were written under earlier keys and not yet rotated forward, also set `ECLIPSVAULT_KEK_RETIRED`
   (the `;`-separated list) so their DEKs still unwrap (item 3).
4. **Supply the audit signing key** (`ECLIPSVAULT_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY`, item 4).
5. **Start the app** with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` and the normal connection string.
6. **Verify** (this is the part people skip):
   - Startup logs the license line and does **not** warn about a missing/malformed KEK.
   - Sign in, complete MFA, and **reveal one secret** — proves the KEK unwraps a real DEK.
   - On the admin **Audit log** page, run **Verify integrity** — the hash chain reports intact.
   - Optionally, export an audit bundle and verify it offline with `EclipsVault.AuditVerifier`.

If step 6 reveals a secret, your restore is real. If it cannot, stop and fix the KEK before trusting
the environment — a half-restored vault that "starts fine" but cannot decrypt is the worst outcome,
because it looks healthy.

## Test the restore (do this on a schedule, not after a disaster)

A backup you have never restored is a hypothesis. Once a quarter (and after any KEK rotation):

1. Restore items 1–2 into a **throwaway** environment.
2. Supply the KEK and audit key from your secret manager.
3. Run step 6 above.
4. Tear the throwaway environment down.

This exercise is also what proves your KEK custody actually works — if you cannot lay hands on the KEK
during a drill, you would not have had it during a real outage either.

## KEK rotation (keeps the recovery window bounded)

Rotating the KEK limits how long any single key must survive to keep old data readable. Generate a new
key, move the previous one into `ECLIPSVAULT_KEK_RETIRED`, restart, then run the rotation from the
admin **Encryption keys** page. Once it reports everything on the current KEK, the retired key can be
dropped from the list — and from that point a backup only needs the current KEK. Full steps are in the
[`README`](../README.md) under *Master key (KEK)*.

## What recovery cannot do

Stated plainly so it is never a surprise (see [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md)): if the KEK and all
retired KEKs are lost, the data is gone. This is a cryptographic guarantee working as intended, not a
failure — it is also why nobody, including the vendor, can read your secrets. Your recovery plan **is**
your KEK-custody plan.
