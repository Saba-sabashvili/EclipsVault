# Production installation

EclipsVault is self-hosted: you run it in your own environment, hold your own keys, and manage your
own database and backups. This is the whole security model — the vendor never has access to your
secrets or your servers. This guide is the production runbook; for feature detail see the README.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A database: SQL Server or PostgreSQL 17+ (see `Database:Provider`).
- A TLS-terminating reverse proxy or ingress in front of the app (the container serves plain HTTP on
  port 8080 inside your network).
- A place to hold a persistent Data Protection key ring directory, shared by every replica.

## 2. Required configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | Database connection string. Use a least-privilege login and enforce TLS (`Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False` on SQL Server, `SSL Mode=Require` on PostgreSQL). |
| `Database__Provider` | `SqlServer` (default) or `Postgres`. |
| `ECLIPSVAULT_KEK` | Master key: `openssl rand -base64 32`. Or use a KMS engine — set `Crypto__Engine=VaultTransit` and the `Vault` settings (see `docker-compose.yml` for the shape). |
| `ECLIPSVAULT_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY` | Base64 PKCS#8 P-256 private key for signing audit checkpoints. |
| `DataProtection__KeyRingPath` | Durable directory shared by all nodes (the keys are sealed at rest with the KEK). |
| `DynamicSecrets__TargetConnectionString` | **Only if you use dynamic secrets or managed rotation.** The database whose logins the vault manages — see [Dynamic secrets: the managed target](#dynamic-secrets-the-managed-target) below. Deliberately separate from `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`. |
| `ECLIPSVAULT_LICENSE` | Your license token (or place it in a `license.key` file in the content root). |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | Must be `Production` (anything other than `Development` disables dev seeding and fallbacks). |
| `ForwardedHeaders__KnownProxies` | The IP(s) of your reverse proxy, so the real client IP is trusted for rate limiting, the IP blacklist, ABAC network rules, and audit. |
| `AllowedHosts` | Your vault's hostname(s), so a spoofed `Host` header is rejected. |

## 3. Apply the schema from your deploy job (not the app)

The running app does not have rights to change the schema. Run migrations once, from your deploy
pipeline, with a login that has DDL rights (which the app's own login does not):

    ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="…" \
    dotnet ef database update --project EclipsVault.Infrastructure --startup-project EclipsVault.Web

For PostgreSQL, use the `EclipsVault.Migrations.Postgres` project and set
`ECLIPSVAULT_DESIGN_PROVIDER=Postgres` (the design-time factory also reads
`ECLIPSVAULT_DESIGN_CONNECTION` if you keep the runtime connection string out of that shell). The app
verifies the schema at startup and refuses to start against a mismatched one.

### Dynamic secrets: the managed target

Skip this unless you use **dynamic secrets** or **managed rotation**. Both work by issuing
`CREATE LOGIN`, `DROP LOGIN`, and `ALTER LOGIN` against the database whose credentials you want the
vault to manage. That needs server-level rights there — `ALTER ANY LOGIN` on SQL Server.

Those rights are why this is a **second, separate connection string**:

    DynamicSecrets__TargetConnectionString="Server=app-db;Database=app;User Id=eclipsvault_credmgr;Password=…;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False"

- **Point it at the database you want managed, not at the vault's own.** Minting credentials on the
  vault's database is almost never what you want, and it is not the default.
- **Use a dedicated login on that server**, granted only `ALTER ANY LOGIN` (plus whatever your role
  statements need). Do not reuse `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`.
- **Why they are separate:** `ALTER ANY LOGIN` can re-password *any* principal on the instance that
  holds it. If the vault's own login held it, a compromise of the running application would reach
  the server that stores the audit trail — so the vault never asks for it. See
  `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` → *Invariants that bound the blast radius*.
- **If it is unset, minting and rotation refuse**, with an error naming this setting. There is no
  fallback to the vault's connection: falling back would quietly require the privilege above.
- The target may be a different server, and in most deployments it should be.

## 4. First administrator

On an empty vault, create the first admin once (screened like any password), then remove the setting:

    Seed__AdminPassword='<a password unique to this deployment>' dotnet EclipsVault.Web.dll

## 5. Run (Docker)

Released images are published to `ghcr.io/saba-sabashvili/eclipsvault` and are **cryptographically
signed** — verify the image and pin it to the digest you verified *before* running it. See
[`VERIFYING.md`](VERIFYING.md), then use the verified `ghcr.io/saba-sabashvili/eclipsvault@sha256:…`
reference below in place of a locally-built tag.

    docker run -d --name eclipsvault \
      -e ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="…" \
      -e Database__Provider=Postgres \
      -e ECLIPSVAULT_KEK="…" \
      -e ECLIPSVAULT_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY="…" \
      -e DataProtection__KeyRingPath=/keyring \
      -e ECLIPSVAULT_LICENSE="EVLIC1.…" \
      -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production \
      -e ForwardedHeaders__KnownProxies="10.0.0.2" \
      -e AllowedHosts="vault.example.com" \
      -v /srv/eclipsvault/keyring:/keyring \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      eclipsvault:local

Put your reverse proxy in front, terminating TLS and forwarding `X-Forwarded-For` /
`X-Forwarded-Proto` to the container.

## 6. Verify

- The app starts and logs `License check: Valid — Licensed to …` (or, unlicensed, a warning line —
  it still runs; licensing is soft).
- Sign in, complete TOTP, open a secret.
- On the admin **Audit log** page, run **Verify integrity** — the chain reports intact.

## 7. Backups

Back up the database **and** the Data Protection key ring directory. The key ring is sealed with your
KEK, so a backup is inert without `ECLIPSVAULT_KEK` — keep the KEK in your secret manager, not beside
the backup.
