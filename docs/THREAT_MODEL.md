# Threat model

This document states what EclipsVault is designed to withstand, and — just as importantly — what it
is **not**. It is the security boundary the product draws. Everything below the line "Out of scope"
is the operator's responsibility, an inherent limit of self-hosted software, or both. Read it
alongside the [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) (which disclaims warranty and places deployment, hosting, and
key management with the operator) and [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) (how to report a vulnerability
and what is in scope for a report).

EclipsVault is **self-hosted**. It runs on infrastructure the operator controls, sealing secrets
with a master key (KEK) the operator holds. The vendor never receives, sees, or stores the operator's
secrets, KEK, database, or vault contents. That single fact shapes everything here.

## Assets

What is worth protecting, in rough order of value:

| Asset | Where it lives | How it is protected at rest |
|---|---|---|
| Secret values (and prior versions) | Database | Envelope encryption: a per-secret AES-256-GCM DEK, wrapped by the KEK. The database holds ciphertext only. |
| The master key (KEK) | Environment / KMS | Supplied out of band; never committed. With `Crypto:Engine=VaultTransit` it never enters the process — the app holds only single-use DEKs. |
| Audit trail | Database | Append-only, hash-chained, with signed checkpoints; independently verifiable offline (`EclipsVault.AuditVerifier`). |
| Authentication material | Database | Passwords as salted Argon2id hashes; TOTP seeds; WebAuthn/passkey public keys; single-use recovery codes as Argon2id hashes. |
| Data Protection key ring | Durable path | Sealed at rest with the KEK; inert without it. |
| Session state / kill switches | Memory or Redis | Server-side revocation and IP blacklist; Redis access itself is password-gated. |

## Actors and trust boundaries

- **Anonymous network attacker** — reaches the app before authenticating.
- **Authenticated user (low privilege)** — a valid account, constrained by ABAC.
- **Authenticated administrator** — a trusted operator of the vault.
- **Database / backup holder** — anyone who obtains the data at rest.
- **Host / process** — anyone with code execution or memory access on the running machine.
- **Operator** — who deploys, configures, hosts, and holds the KEK.
- **Vendor / supply chain** — the released artifacts and the pipeline that builds them.

## In scope — threats EclipsVault is designed to resist

Each control makes the attack *harder or evident*, not metaphysically impossible.

1. **Reading secrets from the database at rest.** Envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM, a DEK per secret,
   KEK-wrapped) means a stolen database, backup, or read replica yields ciphertext. The KMS engine
   keeps the KEK out of the app process entirely.
2. **Password guessing / credential stuffing.** Argon2id hashing, per-account lockout, a per-IP rate
   limiter, and screening every password against a bundled compromised-password corpus — at change
   time *and* at first-admin bootstrap.
3. **Single-factor compromise.** MFA is mandatory: no session cookie exists until a second factor
   passes. TOTP or passkeys (WebAuthn); high-sensitivity reveals on a stale session force step-up
   re-authentication before any decryption.
4. **Over-broad or lateral access.** Attribute-based access control evaluates clearance × environment
   × trusted-network × time-window on every secret, with project boundaries. Sharing crosses the
   project boundary only and never raises the clearance ceiling. Grant revocation is issuer-scoped
   and refuses indistinguishably from "not found" (closes the IDOR a naive revoke-by-id would open).
5. **Tampering and repudiation.** The audit trail is fail-closed (a reveal that cannot be audited
   aborts *before* decrypting), hash-chained for tamper evidence, and checkpoint-signed so an exported
   bundle can be verified offline against the public key.
6. **Session theft and stale sessions.** Server-side revocation, sign-out-everywhere, and a password
   change that revokes every other session — the device holding the old password is turned out on its
   next request.
7. **Brute force and intrusion.** An IP blacklist keyed by canonical range (O(1) lookup), automated
   intrusion response, trusted-network rules, and decoy/honey-token secrets that sit outside the
   normal ABAC rules to catch a snooping insider.
8. **Long-lived standing credentials.** Dynamic secrets are minted on demand and destroyed at lease
   end; a credential the vault fails to destroy is escalated to a critical alert rather than silently
   marked done.
9. **Dependency supply chain (the code you build).** The Core project is BCL-only (zero third-party
   packages); versions are pinned centrally with committed lockfiles; CI restores in locked mode and
   fails on any vulnerable dependency; a CycloneDX SBOM is emitted per build.
10. **Configuration and credential leakage.** The database connection string is absent from committed
    config; the KEK comes from the environment or a KMS; TLS to the database is enforced by
    configuration; forwarded-header and `AllowedHosts` validation reject a spoofed client IP or Host.

## Out of scope — the boundary

These are **not** defended by EclipsVault. They are the operator's responsibility, an inherent limit
of self-hosted software, or both. A deployment that ignores them is not protected regardless of the
controls above.

1. **A compromised host.** If an attacker has root on the running machine, or can read process
   memory, they can reach the KEK and decrypted values in use. EclipsVault protects data **at rest
   and in the database** — not against an adversary who already owns the machine the vault runs on.
   Host hardening, OS patching, and isolation are the operator's.
2. **A malicious or compromised operator/administrator.** An administrator can, by design,
   administer. EclipsVault makes privileged actions **audited and tamper-evident**, not impossible.
   It does not defend against a trusted insider who holds the operator role.
3. **Loss of the KEK is permanent data loss.** There is no vendor backdoor and no recovery path. If
   the current and all retired KEKs are lost, every secret is cryptographically unrecoverable — this
   is a property, not a bug. Custody, rotation, and backup of the KEK are the operator's
   responsibility; keep it in a secret manager, **not** beside the database backup.
4. **Deployment and network security.** TLS termination, reverse-proxy configuration, firewalling,
   network exposure, database hardening, and secret-store choice are outside the application. It
   ships fail-closed defaults (production disables dev seeding and fallbacks; a missing KEK or a
   passwordless Redis refuses to start) but cannot enforce the infrastructure around it. See
   [`docs/INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).
5. **The database or backup holder who *also* holds the KEK.** Ciphertext plus the key is plaintext.
   Separating the two — different systems, different access — is the operator's job, and the reason
   the KEK belongs in a KMS or secret manager rather than an environment file next to the dump.
6. **The user's endpoint.** A compromised browser or device belonging to a legitimate user, malware
   that scrapes the clipboard after a one-shot reveal, or screen capture — EclipsVault reveals a
   value to an authenticated, authorized user; what happens on their machine is beyond it.
7. **Physical access and memory acquisition** of the host.
8. **Availability / denial of service** beyond the built-in per-IP and per-account throttling.
   EclipsVault is not DDoS mitigation; absorbing volumetric attacks is the operator's edge.
9. **The systems you point it at.** The security of the KMS, identity provider (SSO/OIDC), database,
   and SMTP relay you configure — and vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies themselves (report
   those upstream) — are outside this boundary.
10. **Cryptographic assumptions.** The controls assume today's primitives (Argon2id, AES-256-GCM,
    ECDSA P-256, SHA-256) hold. A future break of an underlying algorithm is out of scope.

## Invariants that bound the blast radius

These hold by construction and are worth stating because they limit how bad a failure can get:

- **Licensing never blocks decryption.** Enforcement is soft — a licensing failure, an expired token,
  or a malformed license degrades to a banner and an audit line. It can *never* lock an operator out
  of their own secrets.
- **Auditing is fail-closed.** A secret read that cannot be written to the audit trail aborts before
  it decrypts. There is no "read now, log later."
- **KEK / DEK separation, and the KMS option removes the KEK from the process** — so the highest-value
  key need not sit in application memory at all.
- **Least privilege at rest.** The application's own database login has no schema (DDL) rights;
  migrations run from the deploy job under a separate login. A compromise of the running app cannot
  rewrite the schema or the audit tables.

## Reporting a weakness

Found something in the in-scope list that does not hold? That is a vulnerability — report it per
[`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). Something in the out-of-scope list is a deployment or design boundary,
not a defect; if you think the boundary is drawn in the wrong place, that is a design discussion, and
also welcome by the same contact.
