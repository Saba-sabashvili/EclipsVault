/// The one place standalone audit rows are written. Hands the entry to
/// <see cref="AuditGroupCommitter"/> and waits until it is durably committed and chained; any
/// failure is escalated to a critical log and rethrown as <see cref="AuditWriteFailedException"/> so
/// the caller aborts (fail-closed).
///
/// The waiting is the contract, not an implementation detail: a reveal is audited <em>before</em>
/// its value is decrypted, so this returning is what makes the row's existence a precondition of the
/// plaintext. Rows are committed in groups because the chain lock is what caps the read path (see
/// the committer), but no caller is ever released early.
