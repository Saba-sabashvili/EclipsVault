///
/// <para>The lock and the head both live in the database, because an in-memory head is correct on
/// one node and silently wrong on two: each replica would seed its own head at startup and never
/// learn of the other's writes, so every audited write on the node that lost a race would collide
/// with the unique sequence index and roll back — permanently, since a losing node never advances.
/// Reading the head inside the lock, from the one place that actually knows it, is what makes
