/// Re-seals secrets written before payloads were bound to their row, so an existing vault can adopt
/// the binding without losing what it holds.
///
/// This only runs while <c>Crypto:AllowUnauthenticatedLegacyBlobs</c> is on, and that is not
/// squeamishness. Re-sealing whatever it finds is indistinguishable from blessing it: an attacker
/// who copies one secret's envelope onto another and marks it legacy would have this hand it back,
/// correctly bound, at the next restart. So it is an operator's deliberate act with a start and an
/// end — turn it on, start once, turn it off — not a permanent repair that quietly launders
/// whatever appears.
///
/// Unlike KEK rotation, which only re-wraps DEKs, changing what a payload is bound to means
/// re-encrypting it: every value passes through memory here. That is the cost of the migration and
/// the reason it happens once rather than on every read.
