/// Applies <see cref="IAuthThrottle"/> to the credential-submitting actions on the controller it
/// decorates. Safe (idempotent) methods pass through unmetered.
///
/// This replaces ASP.NET's built-in rate limiter, whose partitions are per-process and therefore
/// grant each replica its own budget. It is a filter rather than middleware so the throttled
/// surface stays declared on the controller it protects, and async so the budget can live in Redis.
///
/// Only unsafe methods spend the budget. The brute-force surface is the POST that submits a
/// password, TOTP, recovery code, or passkey assertion — a GET renders a form or is the SSO
/// callback, and none of them test a caller-supplied secret. Metering those too would let a shared
/// NAT (one office behind one address) 429 its own users on ordinary page loads and SSO returns,
/// spending the guessing budget on traffic that does no guessing.
